    "We'll miss Aunt Bev and remember her as a strong, practical person who cared deeply for her friends, family and animals. Our thoughts are with Dani, Damien, Lara and their families, as well as Bev's sisters Kay, Gill, and Claire. While we can't be there in person, we send our love. Lawson, Gareth, and Cameron",

    "Shell, you will be missed so very much. You were always such an amazing friend, so full of energy, laughter and sheer bloody determination. I will miss your sense of humor, incredibly sharp wit and love of life. You were one of the strongest women it has been my privilege to know. From the hilarious flatting days and many an around the mountain pub crawl, to our shared music tastes, to the more recent phone catch ups when I was driving home from Welly - it's been a hell of a ride. Love you always my fav Bogan sister. Hope you are partying with Mike and a few others now. Doug and Faye, my heart goes out to you both in this incredibly hard time. Sending all of my love and great big hugs to you both. X X X X Jenny Gunn"
